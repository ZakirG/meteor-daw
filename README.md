##### A mobile-friendly music sequencing web app written in MeteorJS. 


###### What's done so far:
- initial layout -- header and footer

###### Feature goals:
- users can select sounds from a list of presets and add new tracks
- each track has 16th note slots for sound clip playback
- users can play back their sequenced instrumentals
- the application is mobile-friendly with smooth use above 320px width
- the application works on chrome and firefox

###### Stretch goals
- tempo selection
- sequences can be bounced & exported to wav, m4a, mp3 files
- users can select from premade sequences 
- users can export their sequences as human-readable text files of metadata (something like, "clap2.wav 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0")
- users can reimport these text files
